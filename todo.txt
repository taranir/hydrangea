 - better filter (multiselects? toggles instead of dropdowns)
 - user labels - horizontal instead of vertical? grouped?
 - add text input for new user?
 - initial check for all transactions
 - check on add for new users/categories
 - get allYears from list of transactions


piggy directive:

for each active:
 - check if need to reset (period + lastreset)
 - get all that match filter + lastreset
 - sum up, update lastupdated and currentTotal

rename settings to addBudget or something

transactionInput
 - newTransaction
 - allUSers
  - addTransaction
 - if add or minus (checkbox) (for upload)


move out filter - for graphs
 - allUsers
 - allCategories
 - allMonths
 - allYears
 - pass in updateFilter

- allUsers/categoires/months/years should be stored in filterService.js

fix online payment (still getting through)

users/categories
