 - better filter (multiselects, +/-/"" for each option, toggles?)
 - arrange user options horizontal instead of vertical?
 - have a text input for new user
 - check upon adding transaction for new options
 - piggy directive
   - for each active budget:
     - check if need to be reset (period + lastreset)
     - get all that match filter + last reset
     - sum up, update lastUpdate and currentTotal
 - settingsDirective should be budgetDirective or something
